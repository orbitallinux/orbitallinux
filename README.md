# Orbital Linux
> This project is still being worked on and is very experimental.

An attempt to remake Orbital Linux with shell scripts.

## Things to note before building
Do **NOT** execute any script without reading its source code for your own security.

Systems with glibc may have problems with dynamic libraries *(This happens especially with the ToyBox package)* after compiling so it's **recommended** to compile all the packages in musl.
